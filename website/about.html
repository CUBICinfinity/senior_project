        My name is Jim Greene. I came from Florida and work at Idaho National Laboratory as a data science intern in material sciences. My wife is from Utah and is finishing her degree in elementary education. I was part of the Slump Virus gaming/YouTube team when me and my siblings became confident that we could accomplish anything.

        I have an open attitude about new projects and fields of study. Because of this, I encourage others to send ideas for things to do or collaborate on. I'd also be happy to just talk about whatever as I'm a highly social introvert.

        I like solving and developing puzzles and have created some Minecraft and Portal 2 content. I am also a Myst fan. I've recently become more interested in social innovation and have done some local research on mental wellness among college students. I've contemplated getting into tabletop role playing.
