This is not a fancy tutorial. It's here to help you better than the official documentation helped me.

#### **View these in the order provided; don't try to memorize everything:**

https://keras.io/#installation (You may choose to install TensorFlow now if you haven’t already.)

https://keras.io/getting-started/functional-api-guide/ (Stop reading after the model diagram.)

https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/ (Stop reading once you get to “Examples”.)

*About callbacks*</br>

*You can use the functional API for unique architechures*</br>
https://machinelearningmastery.com/keras-functional-api-deep-learning/
</br>

At this point you should have a good understanding. Google things and refer to the documentation as needed.

#### **Keras in R**
I prefer using Keras in Python, but you can also run it from R.</br>
The R Keras installation can be a little unfriendly, so here are some tips:

To save time, avoid issues by updating these packages first.</br>
`install.packages(c("ps", "Rcpp", "digest", "processx", "devtools"))`

Install TensorFlow.</br>
`devtools::install_github("rstudio/tensorflow")`</br>
`tensorflow::install_tensorflow()` Include the argument `gpu=TRUE` if you want GPU processing.

Verify TF installation.</br>
`library(tensorflow)`</br>
`tensorflow::tf_config()`

Install Keras.</br>
`devtools::install_github("rstudio/keras")`</br>
If you update other packages when prompted and one of them fails, perform `install.packages('package_name')` separately, then run `devtools::install_github("rstudio/keras")` again.

Allow installation of Miniconda unless you insist otherwise.

If you are familiar with R, the Keras usage will be easy to understand: https://keras.rstudio.com/
